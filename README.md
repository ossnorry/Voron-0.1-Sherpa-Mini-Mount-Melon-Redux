Remix that applies some tweaks and fixes to BoothyBooth's wonderful design for the Dragon Hotend (TL and Phaetus)


# Same original instructions apply 

Installation Printing Notes

1. Please refer to the General Assembly PDF for required for assembly. 
2. No parts require support if printed in the uploaded orientation. The RH Fan duct will require the integrated support to the bolt fix to be removed.

## Appended
The modified part has less contact with the bed surface, while supports aren't required. You may see more success with a brim or discs.
